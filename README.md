# CSES-Practice

### Contribution Format  

When adding a solution, please include the following into the **Thinking Process.md**:  

- **Problem Link**: Provide the link to the original problem.  
- **Thinking Process**: Briefly explain how you approached and solved the problem (your reasoning, key observations, or strategy).  

Example:  

- **Problem Link**: [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A)  
- **Thinking Process**: I noticed that the problem requires calculating how many tiles are needed. This comes down to dividing the dimensions by the tile size and rounding up, since any leftover area still needs a tile.
